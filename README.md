This is the repository for the 2020 LGSI Internship program

# Subject
Developing objects that address the discomfort of the visually impaired

# Development Background
- Blinded people are more sensitive to minor changes in the position of objects than ordianry people.


- Therefore, we can provide visually impaired people with wearable device that becomes their eyes and ears, telling them the location of objects they want to find.


- We think that it would be helpful for blinded people and work with LG Smart TV effectively.

**So, This application we developed is named "Eye Helper"**
